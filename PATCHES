What and where?
---------------

Here's a list of patches and forks written by you guys out there, sorted
alphabetically by the author's name:

    - https://github.com/onodera-punpun/lariza

        Various patches, such as smooth scrolling and mouse gestures.

There might be more, you should check GitHub's network graph:

Why?
----

This project has a rather strict policy when it comes to accepting
patches. Feature requests often get turned down. I apologize for that.

Let me quote http://suckless.org/hacking:

    There are two types of patches: The ones that fit to your personal
    taste and the ones you think should be included in mainline.

Bug fixes and the like should be included in mainline and I'm very happy
to receive pull requests for those types of things. Patches that fit
your personal taste are a different story. They will probably not be
accepted. Sorry.

I recognize that you put effort into your work. Let's not waste it. If
you wish your patches to be included in this list, just drop me a note
or open a pull request.

Thank you!
