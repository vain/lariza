Release history for lariza

next
  [Fixed]
  - User input is now properly escaped when used for keyword based
    searching (fixes #47).

v17.05  2017-05-21
  [Fixed]
  - Automatically adding the "file://" prefix didn't work (reliably) if
    a message was sent to an already running instance.

  [Changed]
  - Autoreloading of crashed web processes has been removed. It doesn't
    make sense anymore since the switch to webkit's multi-process model.
    Instead, we now simply announce the crash in the location bar.
  - Refuse to quit if there are active downloads. The user has to cancel
    them explicitly. (To improve workflow a little bit, the download
    manager now also knows a "Mod1 + q" hotkey.)

  [Added]
  - WebGL can now be enabled by setting an environment variable. This is
    an experimental feature, though.

v17.02  2017-02-16
  [Fixed]
  - As requested by WebKit's API documentation, we now wait for the
    "ready-to-show" signal after a "create" signal. This fixes crashes
    after you chose "Open link in new window" from a context menu.

  [Changed]
  - The "search prefix" has been changed from "/" to ":/". This means,
    in order to search for text in a web page, you now have to enter
    something like ":/your search term" into the input box.
  - Lariza now uses WebKit's multi-process model. This means that (most)
    tabs run as independent processes. If one tab crashes, it should not
    affect the others.
  - The GtkLevelBar to show page loading progress has been removed.
    Instead, we now use the progress bar which is already included in
    GtkEntry (the input box). This is mostly a cosmetic change, but it
    also eliminates some GTK warnings.

  [Added]
  - An external user-supplied program can be called for the current URI
    or for hyperlinks/images/videos/audio files.
  - Lariza will now automatically add a "file://" prefix for local
    files.
  - Hotkeys have been unified. It is now largely irrelevant whether the
    location bar or the web view has focus.
  - Lariza can be instructed to write each visited URI to a file.

v16.12  2016-12-24
  [Fixed]
  - Lariza no longer reports download progress below 0% or above 100%.
    (Workaround for what appears to be a WebKit2GTK+ bug.)

  [Changed]
  - We no longer explicitly set the X11 window's class and name. Let
    GTK+ do this job. The actual class and name should be unchanged,
    though (WM_CLASS(STRING) = "lariza", "Lariza").

    This does not affect tabbed which is still run with "-n lariza".

    This change fixes a GTK+ deprecation warning.

v16.09  2016-09-03
  [Changed]
  - Web extensions are now looked for in ~/.config/lariza/web_extensions.

v16.06  2016-06-26
  [Fixed]
  - Gtk warnings.

  [Changed]
  - Except for the default window size, there are no hardcoded pixel
    values anymore. Should make it a little easier to run lariza on
    HiDPI screens. (Sorry, not tested, I don't have one.)

  [Added]
  - New key bindings F2 and F3: Go backward and forward, just like the
    existing mouse key binds do.

v16.01  2016-01-05
  [Fixed]
  - Issue #14: "Keypad enter" now registers as "commit", i.e. "start
    loading the URL" or "begin searching for search term".
  - Issue #15: lariza no longer tries to create local file names with
    directory separators in them when downloading files.
  - lariza no longer sets the window title to an empty string.

  [Changed]
  - For the sake of consistency, $LARIZA_WEB_EXTENSIONS_DIR has been
    removed.

  [Added]
  - Manpages are now available.

v15.09 and earlier releases
  - Sorry, the CHANGES file did not exist back then. Please refer to the
    Git log.
